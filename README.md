## Project 1: IMDB Dataset Analysis
- Analyzed IMDB Top 250 movies dataset using Python in Google Colab.
- Cleaned data by converting dates, standardizing currency values, and handling missing values.
- Conducted EDA to visualize rating distributions, release year trends, and budget vs. earnings comparisons.
- Visualized key insights using histograms, line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- Found that high budgets don't guarantee high earnings, factors like storyline and cast are crucial.
