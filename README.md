HelloðŸ‘‹,

Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Saka Wijaya, and I have a strong interest in the field of Data Science and am always eager to learn and develop my skills in this area. Below, you will find an overview of some of the projects I have worked on, showcasing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## Project 1: IMDB Dataset Analysis
- Analyzed IMDB Top 250 movies dataset using Python in Google Colab.
- Cleaned data by converting dates, standardizing currency values, and handling missing values.
- Conducted EDA to visualize rating distributions, release year trends, and budget vs. earnings comparisons.
- Visualized key insights using histograms, line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- Found that high budgets don't guarantee high earnings, factors like storyline and cast are crucial.
### Results
Corelation between world wide gorss and Bugdet films

## Project 2: Heart Disease Classification using Random Forest
- Developed a machine learning model to classify the presence of heart disease using Python.
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
- Using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the models.
- Trained and evaluated models, with Random Forest achieving the best performance (Accuracy: 88.3%, Precision: 88.3%, Recall: 88.3%, F1 Score: 88.3%).
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of the Random Forest model in classifying heart disease presence, indicating its suitability for similar tasks.

## Project 3: Electricity Consumption Forecasting using XGBoostregressor
This project involves forecasting electricity consumption for the next year using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost regressor. The dataset used for this analysis includes various factors such as consumption, production, nuclear energy, wind energy, hydroelectric power, oil and gas consumption, coal consumption, solar energy, and biomass energy.
### Results
The XGBoost regressor model used in this analysis achieved a percentage error of 6.1507% in forecasting electricity consumption

## Project 4: OWID Covid 19 Analysis
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset using Python. The analysis includes data exploration, data cleaning, and visualization. Additionally, a dashboard is created using Google Looker Studio to visualize the insights derived from the dataset. The dashboard provides information on which country has the highest total cases, daily cases, the comparison between deaths and total cases, and the comparison between population and vaccination rates in each country.

## Project 5: Supermarket Sales Analysis
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Supermarket Sales dataset using Python. The analysis includes data exploration, data cleaning, and deriving insights from the dataset. With this project, we can determine the number of transactions from January to March, customer payment habits, the number of male and female customers, whether customers are members or not, and identify the target customers for each product line. These insights can be used by the company to optimize inventory management, tailor marketing strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive sales growth.
