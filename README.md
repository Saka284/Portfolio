## Project 1: IMDB Dataset Analysis
- Analyzed IMDB Top 250 movies dataset using Python in Google Colab.
- Cleaned data by converting dates, standardizing currency values, and handling missing values.
- Conducted EDA to visualize rating distributions, release year trends, and budget vs. earnings comparisons.
- Visualized key insights using histograms, line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- Found that high budgets don't guarantee high earnings, factors like storyline and cast are crucial.

## Project 2: Heart Disease Classification using Random Forest
- Developed a machine learning model to classify the presence of heart disease using Python.
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
- Using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the models.
- Trained and evaluated models, with Random Forest achieving the best performance (Accuracy: 88.3%, Precision: 88.3%, Recall: 88.3%, F1 Score: 88.3%).
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of the Random Forest model in classifying heart disease presence, indicating its suitability for similar tasks.

## Project 3: Electricity Consumption Forecasting using XGBoostregressor
This project involves forecasting electricity consumption using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost regressor. The dataset used for this analysis includes various factors such as consumption, production, nuclear energy, wind energy, hydroelectric power, oil and gas consumption, coal consumption, solar energy, and biomass energy.
### Results
The XGBoost regressor model used in this analysis achieved a percentage error of 6.1507% in forecasting electricity consumption
