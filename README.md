## Project 1: IMDB Dataset Analysis
- Analyzed IMDB Top 250 movies dataset using Python in Google Colab.
- Cleaned data by converting dates, standardizing currency values, and handling missing values.
- Conducted EDA to visualize rating distributions, release year trends, and budget vs. earnings comparisons.
- Visualized key insights using histograms, line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- Found that high budgets don't guarantee high earnings, factors like storyline and cast are crucial.

## Project 2: Heart Disease Classification using Random Forest
- Developed a machine learning model to classify the presence of heart disease using Python.
- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
- Using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the models.
- Trained and evaluated models, with Random Forest achieving the best performance (Accuracy: 88.3%, Precision: 88.3%, Recall: 88.3%, F1 Score: 88.3%).
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of the Random Forest model in classifying heart disease presence, indicating its suitability for similar tasks.
